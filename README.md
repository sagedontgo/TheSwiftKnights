# The Swift Knights
[Discord](http://discord.swiftiessmp.gay)

### THE BASICS
**The Swift Knights** is a Minecraft RPG data pack that is based on the 10 Taylor Swift eras. Players progress and unlock the knights by playing and completing quests. When the player reaches the Midnights knight, which is currently the most powerful knight, they are able to rebirth and start over as the evolved version of their knight.

The following is the tree that you must climb: Fearless, Debut, evermore, Speak Now, folklore, 1989, reputation, Red, Lover, Midnights

There are 3 types of abilities: Attack, Defense, and Ultimate abilities.
To use them, you must have the applicable card equipped in your offhand. 

To upgrade, players must craft the "Era Amulet", which will automatically unlock the next knight when right clicked if they have the correct items in their inventory.

**None of this is final and is just here for me to jot down some notes, but also for you to suggest if you happen to have any suggestions.**
